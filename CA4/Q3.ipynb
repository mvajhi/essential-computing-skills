    "این گزارش به تحلیل و بررسی یک پایپ‌لاین پیش‌پردازش داده برای مجموعه داده‌های ویدیویی یوتیوب (از کشورهای آمریکا و کانادا) می‌پردازد. هدف اصلی این پروژه، پروفایل کردن کد اولیه، شناسایی نقاط ضعف و گلوگاه‌های (bottlenecks) عملکردی آن و در نهایت، بهینه‌سازی کد برای افزایش سرعت و کاهش مصرف حافظه است. این فرآیند یکی از مهارت‌های کلیدی در علم داده و مهندسی نرم‌افزار است، زیرا کارایی در پردازش داده‌های بزرگ، امری حیاتی محسوب می‌شود.\n",

    "کد اولیه در تابع `original_preprocessing_pipeline` پیاده‌سازی شده و سپس با استفاده از ابزارهای پروفایلینگ مانند **cProfile**، **memory\\_profiler** و **line\\_profiler** مورد تحلیل قرار گرفته است. در نهایت، نسخه بهینه‌سازی شده کد در تابع `safe_optimized_preprocessing` ارائه و عملکرد آن با نسخه اولیه مقایسه شده است."

    "#### **جاسازی متون (Text Embedding)**\n",
    "\n",
    "برای ستون‌های متنی `title`، `tags` و `description`، از مدل `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` کتابخانه `sentence-transformers` برای تبدیل متن به بردارهای عددی (embedding) استفاده می‌شود. این کار به مدل‌های یادگیری ماشین اجازه می‌دهد تا محتوای متنی را درک کنند.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **نقطه ضعف**: در این بخش، کد با استفاده از یک حلقه `for` و دستور `df.iloc[i][col]` به هر سطر دیتافریم دسترسی پیدا می‌کند که در پانداز (Pandas) بسیار ناکارآمد است.\n",

    "\n",
    "  - **نقطه ضعف**: مشابه مرحله قبل، این کار نیز با یک حلقه `for` انجام شده که سرعت پردازش را به شدت کاهش می‌دهد.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **پردازش تاریخ و زمان**\n",
    "\n",
    "ستون `publish_time` که به فرمت رشته‌ای است، به فرمت تاریخ و زمان تبدیل شده و ساعت انتشار ویدیو در ستون جدیدی به نام `publish_hour` استخراج می‌شود.\n",

    "    نمودار مصرف حافظه نشان داد که در حین اجرای پایپ‌لاین، مصرف حافظه به حدود **۲۰۰۰ مگابایت (۲ گیگابایت)** می‌رسد. این حجم بالا ناشی از ایجاد لیست‌ها و دیتافریم‌های موقت در هر مرحله و عدم استفاده بهینه از حافظه است.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **`line_profiler` (پروفایلینگ خط به خط):**\n",

    "      * **مشاهده:** متد `apply` به طور چشمگیری کندتر از دو متد دیگر است (بیش از ۶ برابر کندتر). متدهای `map` و `numpy.where` عملکردی بسیار سریع و نزدیک به هم دارند.\n",
    "      * **تفسیر:** دلیل این اختلاف سرعت، **برداری نبودن (Non-Vectorized)** متد `apply` است. `apply` با یک تابع لامبدا، عملیات را به صورت یک حلقه در سطح پایتون بر روی تک‌تک ردیف‌ها اجرا می‌کند که سربار (overhead) بسیار بالایی دارد. در مقابل، `map` و `numpy.where` عملیات را به صورت **برداری (Vectorized)** و در سطح کدهای کامپایل شده C اجرا می‌کنند که باعث می‌شود پردازش به صورت یکجا و با سرعت بسیار بالاتری انجام شود. 🐢 `apply` در مقابل 🚀 `map` و `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **مصرف حافظه (نمودار وسط):**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **مشاهده:** هر سه روش از نظر مصرف حافظه تفاوت چندانی با یکدیگر ندارند.\n",
    "      * **تفسیر:** بخش عمده حافظه مصرفی مربوط به نگهداری DataFrame اصلی و ستون جدید ایجاد شده است. خود عملیات محاسباتی، حافظه اضافی قابل توجهی مصرف نمی‌کند. به همین دلیل، تفاوت معناداری در این معیار دیده نمی‌شود.\n",

    "  * **بار پردازنده (نمودار سمت راست):**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **مشاهده:** `map` و `numpy` به طور قابل توجهی بار CPU بیشتری (۵۰٪) نسبت به `apply` (حدود ۱۸٪) ایجاد کرده‌اند.\n",
    "      * **تفسیر:** این نتیجه شاید در نگاه اول عجیب به نظر برسد، اما کاملاً منطقی است. **بار CPU پایین برای `apply` یک نقطه ضعف است** و نشان می‌دهد که این فرآیند بیشتر در حالت انتظار (waiting) به سر می‌برد تا پردازش واقعی. این انتظار به دلیل سربار مفسر پایتون برای هر فراخوانی تابع است. در مقابل، **بار CPU بالا برای `map` و `numpy` یک نقطه قوت است** و نشان می‌دهد که این متدها از تمام ظرفیت پردازنده برای انجام محاسبات به صورت فشرده و سریع استفاده می‌کنند و به همین دلیل در زمان بسیار کمتری به پایان می‌رسند."

    "برای درک بهتر رفتار این متدها با افزایش حجم داده، آزمایشی با تعداد ردیف‌های مختلف (۱۰ هزار، ۱۰۰ هزار و ۱ میلیون) انجام شد. نتایج در نمودار زیر با مقیاس لگاریتمی نمایش داده شده است.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * **تفسیر:**\n",
    "    این نمودار تأیید می‌کند که ضعف عملکرد `apply` یک مشکل بنیادی است و با بزرگ‌تر شدن دیتاست، **هزینه استفاده از آن به شدت افزایش می‌یابد**. برای کار با داده‌های بزرگ (Big Data)، استفاده از روش‌های برداری مانند `map` و `numpy.where` کاملاً ضروری است.\n",

    "  * **بازنده عملکرد:** متد `pandas.apply` برای عملیات ساده و قابل برداری‌سازی.\n",
    "\n",
    "**توصیه‌های عملی:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  ✅ **برای جایگزینی مقادیر بر اساس یک دیکشنری (Mapping):** همیشه از `pandas.map()` استفاده کنید. این روش خوانا، بهینه و سریع‌ترین گزینه برای این کار است.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  ✅ **برای شرایط پیچیده‌تر (Conditional Logic):** از `numpy.where()` استفاده کنید. این تابع بسیار قدرتمند، سریع و انعطاف‌پذیر است و می‌تواند شرایط پیچیده‌تری را مدیریت کند.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  ⚠️ **چه زمانی از `apply()` استفاده کنیم؟** استفاده از `apply` را به مواردی محدود کنید که عملیات مورد نظر **ذاتاً قابل برداری‌سازی نیست**. برای مثال، زمانی که تابع شما نیاز به فراخوانی یک سرویس خارجی (API)، انجام محاسبات پیچیده روی رشته‌ها یا اجرای منطقی دارد که در توابع NumPy یا Pandas پیاده‌سازی نشده است. در غیر این صورت، `apply` باید آخرین گزینه شما باشد."

    "پاسخ سوالات تشریحی:\n",
    "### ۱. پروفایلینگ در محیط Production چگونه انجام می‌شود؟\n",
    "پروفایلینگ در محیط Production باید با دقت و به‌صورت غیرمزاحم انجام شود تا عملکرد سیستم تحت تأثیر قرار نگیرد. ابزارهایی مانند **py-spy**، **cProfile** (با حالت نمونه‌برداری)، یا APMهایی نظیر **NewRelic**، **Datadog** و **Prometheus** با **Grafana** برای این منظور استفاده می‌شوند. برخلاف محیط توسعه که امکان ردیابی دقیق کل برنامه وجود دارد، در محیط Production تمرکز بر جمع‌آوری اطلاعاتی مانند زمان پاسخ توابع، مصرف CPU و حافظه، شناسایی گلوگاه‌ها و ثبت خطاهای رایج است. برای حفظ کارایی سیستم، پروفایلینگ با حداقل دخالت و به‌صورت دوره‌ای انجام می‌شود و داده‌ها برای تحلیل ذخیره می‌گردند. هدف اصلی، شناسایی رفتارهای غیرمنتظره در عملکرد واقعی سیستم برای کاربران است.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ۲. تفاوت پروفایلینگ منابع در برنامه‌های تک‌ریسمانه و چندریسمانه چیست؟\n",
    "در برنامه‌های **تک‌ریسمانه**، منابع مانند CPU و حافظه به‌صورت متوالی توسط یک نخ استفاده می‌شوند. این امر پروفایلینگ را ساده‌تر می‌کند، زیرا توابع به ترتیب اجرا شده و گلوگاه‌ها با ابزارهایی مانند **cProfile** یا **line_profiler** به‌راحتی شناسایی می‌شوند. اما در برنامه‌های **چندریسمانه**، اجرای هم‌زمان توابع در نخ‌های مختلف، تحلیل را پیچیده‌تر می‌کند. ابزارهای سنتی برای این سناریو کافی نیستند و باید از ابزارهای پیشرفته‌تر مانند **threaded-profiler**، **Py-Spy**، **perf** یا ابزارهای سیستمی (مانند **htop** و **perf record**) استفاده کرد تا رفتار نخ‌ها بررسی شود. مشکلات خاص چندریسمانی مانند **race condition**، **deadlock** یا توزیع نابرابر منابع بین نخ‌ها، تحلیل را دشوارتر می‌کنند. بنابراین، استفاده از پروفایلرهایی با قابلیت تحلیل فعالیت‌های هم‌زمان و مدیریت **thread-safe** ضروری است."
